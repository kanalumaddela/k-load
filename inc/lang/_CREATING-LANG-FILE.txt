IMPORTANT INFO
  - In some of the language strings is/are `%s`. These represent replacements of where
    certain arguments (such as a number) are passed and inserted at that point. If you see a
    language string with this. DO NOT remove the `%s`. It MUST be in the string.

  - Some language keys look like this:

        'updates_available'            => [
            'There is %s update available',   // singular
            'There are %s updates available', // plural
        ],

    This means the language key is used where there are plural based conditions. All you need to
    worry about is that the 1st item is the singular phrase, while the 2nd is the plural. Again in the
    example above the `%s` be kept in the string.


1. Copy the `en.php` and rename it for the appropriate language key. For example `es.php` for Spanish and so forth.

2. Edit the file updating all the language strings.

3. Open your `data/constants.php` (or create it if you haven't) and define the `APP_LANGUAGE`
   as whatever your language key is.
