1. Copy the "k-load/inc/migrations" and "k-load/inc/updates" folder and MERGE/OVERWRITE them with the respective folders on your website.
	- If you have K-Load installed at loading.example.com, the folder paths would be "inc/migrations" and "inc/updates"
	- If you have K-Load installed in a folder such as www.example.com/loading, the folder paths would be "loading/inc/migrations" and "loading/inc/updates"

2. Open the K-Load dashboard in your browser and go to the "Core" section which is underneath the "Admin" tab on the left sidebar.

3. You should see in the upper right hand of the page there is a box that says "Updates".
   It should say there are x updates available along with the latest version and your current version.

4. Click the "Update" button and then select "OK" in the popup to automatically copy and update the loading screen.

5. If there are issues, an error will show or you may have to check the "action" logs and "mysql" logs which
   are located in "data/logs/action" and "data/logs/mysql" which are relative to the root of the K-Load installation.

6. If you see an error in the logs relating to failing to copy the files for the update, manually upload the files yourself by
   extracting the included "full-update.zip" and OVERWRITING the files in your K-Load installation. Its folder structure is very
   similar so upload it as if you were uploading K-Load itself.
