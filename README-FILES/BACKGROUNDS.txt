/*** How do I change/add a static background? ***/

1. Open up the theme css file which is located in `themes/<theme>/assets/<theme>.css` where `<theme>` is the name of the theme folder.
	- e.g. For `neuron` the css file would be `themes/neuron/assets/neuron.css` if that file exists.
2. If the file exists, add this inside:

body:before, body::before {
    background-image: url(IMAGE_LINK_GOES_HERE);
}

3. If the file doesn't exist open the theme template file located in `themes/<theme>/pages/loading.twig`
4. Search for `{% block css %}` if it exists. If it does exist, place the css code above^ after #2 inside `{% block css %}` ...some css code... `{% endblock %}`
5. If it does not exist, create it:

{% block css %}
<style>
body::before {
    background-image: url(IMAGE_LINK_GOES_HERE);
}
</style>
{% endblock %}

/*** How do I enable a slideshow background? ***/

1. Create a `global` folder inside `assets/img/backgrounds`.
2. Place your images inside `assets/img/backgrounds/global`.
3. Refresh the loading screen or clear cache to see changes. Backgrounds are cached for 60s.
4. To create a slideshow for a specific gamemode, create a folder named after the gamemode id.
  - For example, for Trouble in Terrorist Town, create a `terrortown` folder in `assets/img/backgrounds` and place your images inside.
5. If you want to upload images, but not immediately use them, create a `disabled` folder INSIDE the type of background folder `e.g. global/disabled` or whatever name you choose, it doesn't matter.
6. K-Load automatically searches for all images and adds them to the list, all you need to do is upload them.

/*** How do I add a video background? ***/


This currently isn't a thing in K-Load mainly cause of the conflict I saw with youtube videos and music.
1. Create a `videos` folder inside `assets`.
2. Upload your videos to `assets/videos`.
  - ALL VIDEOS MUST BE `.webm` ONLY.
3. Open up `assets/css/loading.css` and paste this in if it does not exist:

#video_background {
    z-index: -9999;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    min-width: 100%;
    min-height: 100%;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
    overflow: hidden;
}

4. Open up the theme template (`themes/<theme>/pages/loading.twig`) and paste this inside the <body></body> section. Remove the 'muted' attribute if you want sound.

<video id="video_background" autoplay loop muted>
    <source src="{{assets}}/videos/NAME_OF_VIDEO_FILE.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>
